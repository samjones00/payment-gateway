# Overview
--------------
The objective is to accept payments from the merchant, pass the request through different stages and return a response describing the outcome. Below is a high level flow of the process.

```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant Merchant
    participant PG as Payment Gateway 
    participant DB as Database
    participant Bank as Mock CKO Bank
    Merchant->>PG: POST Payment Request
    PG-->>DB: Save to Database
    PG->>Merchant: Return accepted  Status (202)

    PG->>Bank: POST HTTP Request 
    Bank->>Bank: Retry If Unavailable     
    Bank->>PG: Return Response
    PG-->>DB: Update Database    
    PG->>Merchant: Return Details (200)
```

## Requirements

- Dotnet 6 SDK
- Docker
- Docker file sharing permissions allowing the `docker-compose` file in `.\MockBank` access to mount a volume. 

## Getting started
-----------------

1. ### Start the mock bank

    ```
    cd .\MockBank
    docker-compose up
    ```
2. ### Start the application

    ```
    cd .\Api\PaymentGateway.Api
    dotnet run
    ```
3. ### Accessing the API

* Use Swagger UI from https://localhost:[portnumber]/swagger
* Use Postman, importing the url https://localhost:[portnumber]/swagger/v1/swagger.json

4. ### Authenticate using a bearer token
    Copy one the JWT's from the [JSON-Web-Tokens](#JSON-Web-Tokens) section


### Example bank responses

| Payment Reference | Response |
|-|-|
|ba1c9df4-001e-4922-9efa-488b59850bc4 | Unsuccessful
|Any other guid | Successful


## JSON Web Tokens
------------------
Authentication and authorization is handled using JSON Web Tokens but due to time constraints and requirements I haven't provided a JWT issuer. However, below are some pre-generated bearer tokens which will authenticate and identify the request.

## Features
- A valid bearer token must be provided to perform any action
- Merchants can only access payment details submitted by themselves

#### Merchant: Apple

# Implementation Details

## API Routing
-------------
I first implemented routes using `MapPost` or `MapGet` using the newer format, but then I found this in the fluent validation documentation at https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/aspnet.html.

> Note that Minimal APIs that are part of .NET 6 donâ€™t support automatic validation.

I have left the `MapRoutes.cs` class in `PaymentGateway.DependencyInjection` for reference.

## Acquiring Bank

All code and configuration for calling the mock CKO bank is separated into it's own `PaymentGateway.AcquiringBank.CKO` project, and is only referenced from the `PaymentGateway.Api` project using startup extensions.

Benefits are:
- Easy swapping out for other bank implementations
- Replacing the mock with a real world bank or (vice versa) with minimal changes
- A step closer for separating the acquiring banks into their own nuget packages for use in other applications.
- Self contained including the appsettings

## The Mock bank endpoint

I'm using a pre-built docker image called mockaco which allows 

## Persistance

The payments are stored and updated using an in-memory cache, but could be swapped out for another implementation of `IRepository`.

## Data security

The credit card number is base64 encoded on writing to the repository and decoded on read using a `CreditCardEncryptionDecorator`, ideally this would use encryption for a NoSQL database or use Column-Level SQL Server Encryption if available.

## Mapping

Automapper is used throughout for mapping, the command/query/domain model mapping is found in `PaymentGateway.Domain` and any acquiring bank profiles are part of `PaymentGateway.AcquiringBank.CKO`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Merchant as Merchant 
    participant Gateway as Payment Gateway
    participant Bank as Bank
    Merchant->>Gateway: Command mapped to Payment Domain Model
    Gateway->>Bank: Payment Domain Model mapped to Bank Request Model
    Bank->>Gateway: Bank Response Model mapped to 
    Gateway->>Merchant: Payment Domain Model mapped to Payment Response 

```

# Extra mile bonus points

- Retry policy with delay when calling the bank endpoint
